A Simple template for a Docker Script.
## PURPOSE
I believe you could find answers to **General Questions** <a href="../../master/README.md" title="" target="_blank">here</a>.  
Don't hesitate to <a href="https://github.com/jodumont/docker/issues/new" title="Ask a question by submitting an issue on github." target="_blank">ask any question</a> even if it's to know which colour is the blue sky ? :)  
But please before, <a href="https://github.com/jodumont/docker/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue" title="Please look for a similar question through all the issues before opening a new one." target="_blank">try to see if someone had a similar question.</a>
